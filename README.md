# search_engine_similarity
### Applying for any json file, such as: Twitter comments or Claims regarding a product or service.

### SCOPE
Here you can find a search engine based in the best algorithms to improve running time and processing, based on the best performance algorithms regarding to: 

- Sarching Algorithms such as: Boundary **binary search**, Sequential Search B0, B1 and B2.
- Sort Algorithms (having in mind that sorting improve performance during the search): Bubble search, insertion-sorge, **merge sort** and quick sort.
- Compressing and Decompressing Algorithms (Elias-Gamma and Elias Delta) can improve the performance of this searching algorithm.
- Intersection Algorithms, such as: Naive, Smallest vs. Smallest, Small Adaptative, Sequential and **Baeza-Yates**.

The best algorithms were highlighted previously, based in simulation and running time measures.

### THE APLICATION
With all this elements in mind, here you can find 216 lines of code that creates an searching algorithm as an application with the followig characteristics:
